## Challenges and Risks

### 1. **Complexity Management**

- **Challenge**: Coordinating multiple agents introduces significant complexity
- **Risk**: Debugging multi-agent interactions can be difficult
- **Mitigation**: Start with simpler patterns, add comprehensive logging and observability

### 2. **Computational Costs**

- **Challenge**: Running multiple LLMs simultaneously is expensive
- **Risk**: Operating costs may be prohibitive for some use cases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement caching strategies
  - Use smaller models for routine tasks
  - Offer local model support (Ollama, etc.)

### 3. **Conversation Coherence**

- **Challenge**: Maintaining context in long multi-agent discussions
- **Risk**: Agents may repeat points or contradict themselves
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strong memory management system
  - Summarization techniques for long contexts
  - Explicit turn protocol enforcement

### 4. **Quality Control**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring agents stay on-topic and productive
- **Risk**: Debates could become circular or unproductive
- **Mitigation**:
  - Robust chat manager with intervention capabilities
  - Clear termination criteria
  - Human oversight options

### 5. **Framework Lock-in**

- **Challenge**: Dependency on specific LLM providers or frameworks
- **Risk**: Vendor lock-in, breaking changes in APIs
- **Mitigation**:
  - Provider-agnostic abstraction layer
  - Support multiple backends (OpenAI, Azure, local)

#### 4. **Key Design Patterns**

**Agent Protocol**

```python
class Agent(Protocol):
    def receive_message(message: Message) -> None
    async def generate_response(context: Context) -> Response
    def get_capabilities(self) -> list[str]
    def get_role(self) -> str
```

**Orchestration Pattern**

```python
class Orchestrator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(
        self, 
        agents: list[Agent], 
        task: Task,
        context: Context
    ) -> OrchestrationResult
```

**Chat Manager**

```python
class ChatManager:
    def select_next_speaker(
        self,
        agents: list[Agent],
        history: ConversationHistory
    ) -> Agent
    
    def should_terminate(
        self,
        history: ConversationHistory
    ) -> tuple[bool, str]
```
