# Design Implementation Analysis

## Executive Summary

Argentum has **successfully implemented the core multi-agent orchestration system** with all three primary patterns. The implementation is production-ready with excellent test coverage (92.2%), comprehensive documentation, and real LLM support. A new agent memory module now provides the foundation for persistent identities, though orchestration integration is still underway. Several advanced features from the design document remain unimplemented.

**Overall Completeness: ~76%** (Core: 100%, Advanced: ~42%)
