      "content": "**Minister of Finance Perspective**\n\n**1. Department's Perspective:**  \nThe Ministry of Finance supports a measured approach to carbon tax increases that balances environmental goals with economic stability. As the Department responsible for fiscal responsibility and sustainable budgeting, our primary concern is ensuring any carbon tax adjustment is implemented in a way that does not unduly burden households or businesses, particularly during a period of economic transition.\n\n**2. Benefits and Concerns from Our Area:**\n*BENEFITS:*\n- Revenue generation: A well-designed carbon tax can create a new revenue stream that can be recycled back into the economy through tax cuts, dividends, or investments in clean energy infrastructure. [Doc 1] notes that revenue recycling can fund community solar programs, which aligns with our objective of promoting sustainable economic growth.\n- Market efficiency: Carbon pricing creates economic incentives for innovation in clean technologies, potentially positioning our country as a leader in emerging markets. The 12% rise in clean-tech jobs mentioned in the April 2025 market report demonstrates this potential economic upside.\n\n*CONCERNS:*\n- Competitiveness: The Ministry of Finance shares concerns about maintaining business competitiveness, particularly for trade-exposed industries. [Doc 1] indicates that incremental increases of $5 per ton maintain competitiveness, suggesting we have some flexibility but must remain cautious about more aggressive hikes.\n- Inflationary pressures: Carbon taxes can contribute to inflation, particularly in energy-intensive sectors, which could erode household purchasing power and potentially trigger broader economic instability.\n\n**3. Specific Impacts and Considerations:**\n- According to [Doc 1], the proposed $5/ton increment would generate significant revenue that could be recycled through dividends or targeted tax cuts, helping to offset increased costs for low-income households.\n- The Ministry of Finance recommends implementing the tax increase alongside a phased approach to dividend distribution, as noted in the implementation notes of [Doc 1].\n- We also recommend quarterly monitoring of global commodity prices to adjust implementation as needed, as suggested in the same document.\n\n**4. Response to Other Ministers:**\nI await positions from the Minister of Environment and Minister of Industry to address their specific concerns. However, I can already identify potential areas of alignment:\n- With the Ministry of Environment: We share the goal of reducing emissions but must ensure revenue recycling mechanisms are in place to maintain public support.\n- With the Ministry of Industry: We support using carbon tax revenue to fund clean-tech innovation, as noted in [Doc 1",
