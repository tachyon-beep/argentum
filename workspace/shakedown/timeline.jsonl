Final perspective: **Minister of Environment Perspective**\n\n**1. Department's Perspective:**  \nThe Ministry of Environment strongly advocates for an immediate and significant increase in the carbon tax to meet our national climate commitments and address the escalating climate crisis. As the department responsible for protecting ecosystems, public health, and ensuring intergenerational equity, we believe that the current carbon price is insufficient to drive the necessary behavioral and industrial changes to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n**2. Benefits and Concerns from Our Area:**\n*BENEFITS:*\n- Climate mitigation: A higher carbon tax creates the economic signal needed to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5\u00b0C highlights the urgency of this action.\n- Co-benefits for public health: Reducing carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels directly improves air quality, leading to fewer respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and premature deaths. Studies have shown that these health benefits often exceed the costs of climate action.\n- Ecosystem preservation: By accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels, we protect biodiversity, prevent habitat loss, and safeguard ecosystem services that underpin our economy and quality of life.\n\n*CONCERNS:*\n- Economic transition challenges: While the carbon tax itself is efficient, we recognize the need for complementary policies to support workers in transitioning industries and ensure just transition principles are upheld.\n- International competitiveness: We share the Ministry of Finance's concern about maintaining competitiveness, but note that many of our major trading partners are implementing similar carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\n**3. Specific Impacts and Considerations:**\n- The current carbon tax level has not demonstrated sufficient impact on emissions reduction trajectories to meet our Paris Agreement targets.\n- According to [Doc 1], a $5/ton increase could be implemented in a way that funds community solar programs, which directly support our department's goals of decentralized renewable energy generation.\n- The Ministry of Environment recommends pairing the carbon tax increase with targeted subsidies for clean energy adoption and energy efficiency upgrades to ensure the burden is shared equitably.\n\n**4. Response to Other Ministers:**\nTo the Minister of Finance's legitimate concerns about economic stability, we propose:\n- Revenue recycling through direct dividends to households, particularly those at lower income levels\n- Funding for just transition programs in fossil fuel-dependent communities\n- Creating a special fund for clean technology innovation, as noted in [Doc 1]\n\nRegarding the Ministry of Industry's potential concerns about"}
